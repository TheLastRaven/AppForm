## Program Rating
Every program has a rating:
  * **garbage** - program doesn't work, or in current state is useless,
  * **bronze** - program is working, but mostly it doesn't,
  * **silver** - program is working, many of the features are working,
  * **gold** - program and most of the features are working,
  * **platinum** - *everything* works flawlessly.
